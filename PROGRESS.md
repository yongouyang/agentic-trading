## 2026-08-30 — Day 6 knowledge extraction → architecture doc

### What was done
- Read all 8 pages of `knowledge-base/day_6/` (page_1.JPG – page_8.JPG), a Chinese
  course series "30天学习量化投资 · Day 6: 量化系统架构" covering the core
  components of a quant trading system.
- Created `docs/quant-system-architecture.html` — a self-contained (no external
  dependencies) HTML architecture document distilling the slides into the
  initial building blocks  of this project:
  1. Why modularize (monolith vs. modular)
  2. System overview: 7 core modules + backtest collaboration loop diagram
  3. Module specifications: responsibilities, I/O contracts, worked examples
     (OHLCV bars, MA5 calc, MA golden-cross strategy, AAPL fill math with
     fees/slippage, risk-rule table)
  4. Core design principles: four roles (Strategy / Risk / Broker / Portfolio),
     low coupling via stable interfaces, DIP, anti-patterns with code examples
  5. Proposed repository skeleton + inter-module data contracts table
  6. Practice roadmap (Bollinger Band breakout-sell scenario)
- Verified rendering with headless Chrome screenshots; fixed a CSS bug
  (`.tree` block missing `white-space: pre`) found during verification;
  removed the temporary screenshots afterward.

### Key decisions
- **HTML over Markdown** for the architecture doc: the content is diagram-heavy
  (module map, flow diagrams, comparison panels), and a single self-contained
  HTML file renders them better than md.
- **Seven top-level modules** adopted as the project skeleton:
  `data/`, `indicator/`, `strategy/`, `risk/`, `broker/`, `portfolio/`, `backtest/`.
- **Interface-first design (DIP)**: modules collaborate through stable
  interfaces, not direct calls. The `Strategy` interface sketch is kept in the
  slides' Go-style syntax, but the implementation language is **not decided yet**
  — the repo currently has no code, only docs and knowledge base.
- **Key domain rule recorded**: the fill report (成交回报) is the only source of
  truth for account state; Strategy never mutates Portfolio directly.
- Doc written in English (user's working language) with original Chinese terms
  annotated where they carry specific meaning.

### What's next (suggested, from Day 6 practice roadmap)
1. `indicator/` — implement Bollinger Bands BB(20,2).
2. `strategy/` — emit sell signal when close breaks above the upper band.
3. `portfolio/` / `broker/` — insufficient-balance / insufficient-position checks.
4. `backtest/` — run one simple strategy end-to-end and produce a report
   (annual return, max drawdown, Sharpe, win rate, profit factor, # trades).
5. Decide the implementation language before writing the first module.
